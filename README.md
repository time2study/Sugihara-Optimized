Aims to study, optimize and implement algorithms of UAVs' path planning appling Genetic Algorithm(ML) which could enable them to work together collecing all data from sensors(3D space) more efficiently. It was written years ago, not in good coding style.

**THIS IS** the major part I worked on during our group project - dronekey

This files contain the source codes of the Sugihara's algorithm (SPLITOUR_TEST) and the Optimized algorithm(GA2OPT_TEST).
The *.jar files are the external support files for the "translation" from JAVA language to Json.
