#### Introduction
Aims to study, optimize and implement algorithms of UAVs' path planning what could enable them to work together collecing all data from sensors(3D space) more efficiently.

**THIS IS the major part which I worked on during our group project - dronekey**

This files contain the source codes of the Sugihara's algorithm (SPLITOUR_TEST) and the Optimized algorithm(GA2OPT_TEST).
The *.jar files are the external support files for the "translation" from JAVA language to Json.
